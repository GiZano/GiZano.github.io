My own E-Portfolio site

In this site there are 4 main pages:
- Home
- About
- Works
- Contacts

## Home
This is the welcome page where you can't do much but navigate to ther other pages.

## About
In this page I talk about myself, replying to a few questions.

## Works
In this page there is a showcase to the works I accomplished.
Every work has it's own page where I talk about the development and there is a little DEMO at the bottom to try it out.
From here you can also access to the special zone "test portfolio", where I host my own playground for future web projects...

## Contacts
In this page there are all the ways you can contact me
