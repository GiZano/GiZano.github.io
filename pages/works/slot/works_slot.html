                    Development and Creation of a Simple Slot Game
                </h1>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    The slot machine is a simple and fun way to learn coding for beginners, that's how I learned more
                    about User Interfaces and basic coding.
                    To do that I used Java, a strong language which has leaded the market for much time.
                </p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    During my first year of high school I decided to start programming, and my first ever project has
                    been the development and realization of a simple slot game. To do this I decided to use Java, a
                    language which makes possibile to use the same compiled code for all the machines.
                </p>
                <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    To develop the game it has been used the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which can
                    give an harsh time for beginners but becomes easier with experience.
                    The window for the application has been built using the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), an open
                    source tool which allows to simply create an user interface for our code.
                    In the window we can find some main components, which are: four labels and a button. The button has
                    an event listeners, which allows to launch a part of the code when clicked. When the button is
                    pressed, three random numbers get generated and displayed in the center labels. While being
                    displayed, the next instructions check if the numbers are all higher than 5, and if so, a winning
                    message get displayed in the lower label. If the condition isn't met, a losing message get
                    displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    On launch, a colorful window appears with the four blank labels and a button above all the other
                    components. On click, three random numbers appear in the labels and a message appears in the label
                    below. If all three numbers are higher than 5 the winning message correctly appears, if not the
                    losing message appears. There isn't any problem in the application except for the fact that the
                    dimension of the window is fixed and by enlarging it the buttons doesn't grow but only the
                    background color expands.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The objective to create a slot machine has been fullfilled completely. The application works but the
                    part of beauty in the widget should be revisioned as it has bright but discordant colors. In general
                    the code has no problems thinking that I was just a beginner in coding.
