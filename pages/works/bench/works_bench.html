                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Every year the school gives a project to develop in groups for the pupils attending tenth grade. In
                    my case the school decided to partecipate in the initiative
                    <a href="https://costruiamogentilezza.org/strumenti-di-gentilezza/le-panchine-viola/"
                        target="_blank"><i>"Costruiamo Gentilezza"</i></a>
                    which is "Let's
                    Build Kindness" in english. For the particular initiative to which the school has decided to join we
                    had to develop a bench, and the best one would be built somewhere in the school complex.
                </p>
                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p class="preList">
                    To develop the project, students had to find a way to build a bench following a few key rules.
                    The bench had to be:
                </p>
                <list class="list">
                    <li>Built with recycled materials;</li>
                    <li>Painted in a shade of violet (except fuchsia), union of red and blue, colors which mean
                        concreteness
                        and profundity, which describe best the kindness;</li>
                    <li>Adorned with a phrase or poem about kindness;</li>
                    <li>Provided with a QR Code sending to the site of the project.</li>
                </list>
                <p class="preList">
                    After inventing a new bench of kindness, the best projects of every class would have been presented
                    to a jury consisting in teachers and the principal.

                    Finally the three best projects will be presented by the students in front of the jury and the
                    principal, deciding which one will be realized.

                    To vote, the jury had three main requirements:
                </p>
                <list class="list">
                    <li>Feasibility;</li>
                    <li>Functionality;</li>
                    <li>Creativity and originality;</li>
                    <li>Disciplinary transversality (number of subjects involved).</li>
                </list>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>
                    To create this project, we decided to utilize pallets, which are made from recycled wood and easy to
                    find, combined with tubular steel, which we can gather from ruined and discarded desks.
                    To actually build the bench, we thought about fitting together the pallets on a skeleton made with
                    the tubular steel welded in a particular shape. In the shape, we decided to add a bike rack, to help
                    people who is helping the environment by giving them a place to put their bycicle.
                    For the decorations we decided to utilize the color lilla, which is a light and sweet shade, giving
                    calmness to who looks at the bench. We also chose to put the phrase "La gentilezza fa nascere
                    gentilezza" which means "Kindness gives birth to kindness" by Sofocle.
                </p>
                <h2>How it ended</h2>
                <p>
                    The project has given to our team a chance to work on something about the real world, making us part
                    of it. It has been an actual success because it has been voted as the best project and it has been
                    realized in the school yard, in front of the main access.
                    It has been a win in every aspect and we had the chance to give everyone a clear message about
                    recycling and kindness.
