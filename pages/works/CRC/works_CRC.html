                    Development and Creation of a Cyclic Redundancy Code Calculator
                </h1>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    On the internet the machines that interact need to find if an error occurs during the trasmission.
                    There are many way to detect and correct one or more errors, and one of these is by using the CRC,
                    Cyclic Redundancy Code. This method uses an internationally standardized generator and is only able
                    to detect errors, without correcting them, making the receiver able to ask the sender to send again
                    the message.
                </p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In the course of System and Networking the class studyed many methods to detect and/or correct
                    errors, and one of these is the use of the CRC. The main scope of this project is to understand more
                    about this method and to learn more about the javascript programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    To develop this calculator the Visual Studio Code editor has been used. This text editor let's the
                    programmer work on different files with different languages, perfect to develop javascript codes
                    which work on a website. The language that as been chosen, as we already said, is javascript, an
                    evolution of java which is born to create scripts for the web. In the code we can find the functions
                    that handle the input and calculate the final CRC, creating the new trasmission ready to be sent to
                    another machine. In the code there are also event listeners for buttons and alerts that tell the
                    user when an input isn't acceptable.
                </p>
                <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    On the original project the user interface (UI), hasn't been treated much to focus on the working
                    part of the code. It asks the user to insert a message to send, which can be both decimal and
                    binary, and a generator code, which has to be in binary. It then proceeds to calculate the CRC and
                    prints in output the data of the calculation and the result of it. Every bug and problem has been
                    fixed and the only point is that probably the code can be fixed to be more efficient or readable.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The objective to create a CRC Calculator has been fulfilled without any big problem or final error.
                    It completely works and made me able to progress in my coding journey, learning more about
                    trasmissions and web applications.
