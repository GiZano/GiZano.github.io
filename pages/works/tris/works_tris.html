                    Development and Creation of the Game Tic-Tac-Toe
                </h1>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many simple projects that student beginners can accomplish.
                    In this one the game "Tic-Tac-Toe" will be developed.
                    To do that we will use the C++ language, skills and knowledge achieved by far by the student, as
                    well as the new knowledge in the functions branch.
                </p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project it has been asked to develop an own version of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game.
                    To do that we will use the C++ language, the only one studyed during the course and that the student
                    was capable of using to solve a problem, even if it's only a light one.
                </p>
                <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    To develop the game it has been used the CLion IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which
                    offers an user-friendly experience with a simple and easy-to-use interface. For this instance, will
                    be used the version 14 of C++, explained and used during the lessons. To build the code the only
                    library used is the "iostream", offering functions to give and receive values as inputs or outputs
                    in the terminal. In the code, classes and methods haven't been used, but functions have been
                    implemented to handle and verify the aspects of the game. To handle the matrix, in the code there
                    are two parallel matrix, where one is made out of chars used to display the matrix, while the other
                    has integers used to easily verify if the game is already ended.
                </p>
                <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    When the program is launched, a message shows the players how to interact with the game. The players
                    can immediatly start playing and choose the cells one at a time, having to choose again if they
                    accidently choose an already selected one. The game goes on until one of the two players puts three
                    simbols in a row or the matrix is full. After the game ends, the players can decide to play again or
                    stop, and close the program.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The prefixed objective has been fulfilled thanks to the correct functioning of all the functions and
                    a right succession of the many instructions that create the code.
                    The only problem we met is that sometimes the IDE tells that the code is too complex to do the
                    Data-Flow Analisis. This means that the Analisis needs more than 5 seconds and the code results too
                    complex. The problem can be solved by trying to simplify the code as the max value (5 seconds) can't
                    be changed in the settings. The warning will be kept in the code as the computational complexity
                    topic hasn't been touched yet during the course.
