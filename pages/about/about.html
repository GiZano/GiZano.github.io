                <h2> Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an italian student attending high school in Italy.
                    I love the tech world and I'm always trying to improve my skills.
                    By now I've only done a few programming and real-life projects for school,
                    which still highly contributed to my <i>problem solving</i> and <i>programming skills</i>.
                </p>
                <h2>What I enjoy most</h2>
                <p>
                    As I already said, I love the tech world, but I've also got many more passions!
                    I also like the church world and photography, even though I haven't learned how to do proper photos
                    yet!
                    I also love the robotics world and I'm studying to create projects with <i>Arduino</i>.
                </p>
                <h2>What do I see in my future?</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all in my future I'm sure I'll continue my studies and maybe get a degree in Computer
                    Engineering.
                    After that I'll always try to improve my skills, not only in the tech branch.
                    Maybe I'll also open my own enterprise to develop softwares and solve problems.
                    If I'm lucky enough I'll also try to get a degree in Italian literature, culture and language.
                    This will develop my humanistic side along with my scientific one which will be developed by my
                    previous studies.
                </p>
